# TKKeyboardControl

TKKeyboardControl adds keyboard awareness and scrolling dismissal (like iMessages app) to any view with only 1 line of code **for Swift4** and it supports **SafeArea**.
This library is inspired by [DAKeyboardControl](https://github.com/danielamitay/DAKeyboardControl).

```ruby

## Usage

Example project included (./Example)

### Adding pan-to-dismiss (functionality introduced in iMessages)

#### Frame based action handler

```swift
view.addKeyboardPanning(frameBasedActionHandler: { keyboardFrameInView, firstResponder, opening, closing in
    // Move interface objects accordingly
    // Animation block is handled for you
})
// Make sure to call self.view.removeKeyboardControl before the view is released.
// (It's the balancing call)
```

#### Constraint based action handler

```swift
view.addKeyboardPanning(constraintBasedActionHandler: { keyboardFrameInView, firstResponder, opening, closing in
    // Move interface objects accordingly
    // Animation block is handled for you
})
// Make sure to call self.view.removeKeyboardControl before the view is released.
// (It's the balancing call)
```

### Adding keyboard awareness (appearance and disappearance only)

#### Frame based action handler

```swift
view.addKeyboardNonpanning(frameBasedActionHandler: { keyboardFrameInView, firstResponder, opening, closing in
    // Move interface objects accordingly
    // Animation block is handled for you
})
// Make sure to call self.view.removeKeyboardControl before the view is released.
// (It's the balancing call)
```

#### Constraint based action handler

```swift
view.addKeyboardNonpanning(constraintBasedActionHandler: { keyboardFrameInView, firstResponder, opening, closing in
    // Move interface objects accordingly
    // Animation block is handled for you
})
// Make sure to call self.view.removeKeyboardControl before the view is released.
// (It's the balancing call)
```

### Supporting an above-keyboard input view

The `keyboardTriggerOffset` property allows you to choose at what point the user's finger "engages" the keyboard.

```swift
view.keyboardTriggerOffset = 44.0;	// Input view frame height

view.addKeyboardNonpanning(frameBasedActionHandler: { keyboardFrameInView, firstResponder, opening, closing in
    // Move interface objects accordingly
    // Animation block is handled for you
})
// Make sure to call self.view.removeKeyboardControl before the view is released.
// (It's the balancing call)
```

### Dismissing the keyboard (convenience method)

```swift
view.hideKeyboard()
```

### Remove the NSNotification observer at the end of a VC's life (convenience method)

```swift
view.removeKeyboardControl()
```

## Notes

### Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) support
`TKKeyboardControl` was made with ARC enabled by default.

## Requirements

- Xcode 8.0 or greater
- iOS9.0 or greater
- Swift4.0 or greater
